- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/amirreza1998/devops-scenarios](https://github.com/amirreza1998/devops-scenarios/)
   cd devops-scenarios
   ```

2. **Navigate to your desired scenario:**
   ```bash
   # For WordPress deployment
   cd wordpress-scenario
   
   # For Vagrant environment
   cd vagrant
   ```

3. **Follow the specific README in each folder for detailed instructions.**


<!--
## 📖 Usage Examples

### WordPress Deployment
```bash
cd wordpress-scenario
docker-compose up -d
